Examples: The Making of 40 Photographs by Ansel Adams Book Review

Title: It may improve your own photography

Review: A great book that gives you background of some of the thoughts that went into the work. Highly valuable insight to be had here. Great images and Ansel was a very good writer.

Title: Excellent Resource into the Mind of a Master
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2010
Review: This is truly a fantastic resource for those who want to "step into" the mind of a master photographer. On a different note, it is also an interesting historical perspective from somebody who has lived through the technological changes in photography and several different "movements" in art. Beyond just providing you with basic "EXIF" or exposure information on his shots, Adams has provided insight into, among other things, what lead up to "seeing" the shot, how he considered technical aspects (especially as it related to his Zone System), how he felt about the scene and his surroundings, and what he did in the darkroom in order to bring out the best in the shot. You also get a very good sense of Adams' philosophy on photography and just life in general.

I learned several interesting things about Adams from this book that I did not know previously - he bracketed shots quite a bit (which made me feel better about not getting the shot perfect the first time, every time), he spent as much time in "post processing" as he did shooting (which made me reconsider how I use modern equivalents like Photoshop and Aperture), even though he bracketed quite often, he really felt you got your best "base" for the shot from the negative, and thus he was a proponent of pre-visualizing shots.

This book is very easy to read and the photographs are nicely reproduced so you can get a sense of what Adams is talking about. It is also subtly dense. While you can read it in a very leisurely manner, picking up points here and there, it is also worthy of serious study. As I have reread favorite sections for a second and third time, I have picked up on nuances in his words that have help me understand the photo better and how I may apply his wisdom to my own photography.

Finally, this book has prompted me to do my own "Making of..." series for 40 of my photographs and write about it on my blog. In that sense, this book has really spurred me to be detail-oriented with my shooting and helped me creatively. It is worth the modest price and has provided me with at least ten-fold in satisfaction.

Title: A master photographer speaking directly to you.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2020
Review: This book is like traveling back in time to attend an Ansel Adams photography workshop. The fact that the book was written by Ansel himself provides the reader with a personal experience. The descriptions of each of these legendary photographs is not only an education in the technical aspects of photography but also its history. You will learn that Ansel was using pioneering techniques in developing and printing to manipulate his images for dramatic effect, a 1940s version of photo shop and lightroom. Required reading for students of photography.

Title: Any Ansel Adams book is a treasure
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2020
Review: The best thing about this book is the wonderful selection of photographs by Ansel Adams. The regrettable thing about it is that the writing is by Ansel Adams. He often uses 30 words to say what can best be said in 6. But that's okay. Better that rather than a good nuts and bolts writer on photography whose photographs look dead and uninteresting, for example . . . BUT - the writing in Adams's revised photo series by Adams is readable and succinct.

Title: A Must for Ansel Fans
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2020
Review: If, like me, you're really into Ansel Adams' photography, you'll love this book. In my opinion, not every photo that Ansel shot was a winner, but, regardless, they were technical marvels. In this book, Ansel gives details on how he shot each photo, often to an incredible point, as in, "Holy mackerel, only Ansel would know that the luminance of the moon was 250 foot candles per square foot (c/ft2)." But that's Ansel: a master of photography who's work will live for a long, long time.

Title: Not for digital.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2010
Review: I thought this book would be great, and I saw that it had rave reviews so I got it. I must say I was fairly disappointed. It's not the book's fault, so it almost seems unfair to give it a low rating. But such is life.

The major problem is that the book describes a process which is film-based rather than digital. Now I knew that going in, but I also figured that digital photography is very analogous to film-based photography, so there was still a lot I could learn. I was wrong. Adams spends a great deal of time discussing the camera he used (almost always large format), the lenses, the filters, the type of film, and the chemicals used in development. Almost all of this is entirely meaningless in a world of 35mm digital cameras. Only the filters have ANY relevance, and even that is extremely limited in a world of post-processing. So all of "the making" included in this book was entirely useless for me, and probably for most of you.

Still, there was value in his discussion of the situation leading up to the photography. Ironically, there was probably more of this than there should have been for a "making of" book! But thank goodness, because it was the only part of the book that was even meaningful to me. And it was not really enough. I struggled to finish the book in the hope that it would prove worthwhile, but I am not convinced that it did. I would not recommend this book.

On the other hand, if you are doing film photography, it may be exactly what you were looking for.
